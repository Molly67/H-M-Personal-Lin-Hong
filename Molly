    <p>Hello!</p >
    <p>My name is Molly, and I am currently an international student studying a foundation course at a language school in New Zealand. Before coming to New Zealand, I gained seven years of work experience in China, two to three of which were closely related to apparel sales.</p >
    <ul>
        <li>In 2016, while studying in Suzhou, I worked part-time at the local H&M store for over a year.</li>
        <li>From 2017 to 2019, I served as a store manager for a large apparel company in Chongqing called “Chongqing Liangying Garment Co., Ltd.”</li>
        <li>In 2021, I worked at Starbucks in Shanghai for over a year, further enhancing my customer service and management skills.</li>
        <li>In 2022, I co-founded a design company in Shanghai and served as managing director until I came to New Zealand.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I am passionate about apparel sales and enjoy helping customers find the right products. My experience working part-time at the H&M store in Suzhou is something I cherish. It gave me a deep understanding of H&M’s values, which I genuinely admire. Now, I hope to rejoin the H&M team during my studies in New Zealand, contributing my experience and enthusiasm while growing alongside the company.</p >
